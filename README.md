# AR-Brain-Visualization

## Overview  

This project was developed by Adrien Hadj-Chaib, Raphael Nacache and Hoang Nguyen.

3D Brain Visualization in augmented reality without physical markers, overlaying a 3D skull model over a real time webcam video feed. 

Used [OpenFace](https://github.com/TadasBaltrusaitis/OpenFace) code snippets for facial feature detection and 3D head rotation estimation. Used C++ OpenGL for the rendering, and C++ OpenCV to capture and process webcam feed.
